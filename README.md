# discontinuous

i made this theme for drafting and being more productive because orange makes me productive for some reason. 
i think it also looks cool.

i also worked on the light mode enough so that it looks pretty.
protip: switch the light mode on and work like that so that you will want to finish said work earlier so that your eyes don't burn. you're welcome.
